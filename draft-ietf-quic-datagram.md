# Introduction

The QUIC Transport Protocol {{!RFC9000}} provides a secure,
multiplexed connection for transmitting reliable streams of application data.
Reliability within QUIC is performed on a per-stream basis, so some frame
types are not eligible for retransmission.

Some applications, particularly those that need to transmit real-time data,
prefer to transmit data unreliably. In the past, these applications have built
directly upon UDP {{?RFC0768}} as a transport, and have often added security with
DTLS {{?RFC6347}}. Extending QUIC to support transmitting unreliable application
data provides another option for secure datagrams, with the added benefit of
sharing the cryptographic and authentication context used for reliable streams.

This document defines two new DATAGRAM QUIC frame types, which
carry application data without requiring retransmissions.

Note that DATAGRAM frames are only meant for unreliable transmissions. Reliable
transmission is already supported by QUIC via STREAM frames.

Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the QUIC IETF mailing list
<quic@ietf.org> or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft:

## Specification of Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
{{?RFC2119}} {{?RFC8174}} when, and only when,
they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# Motivation

Transmitting unreliable data over QUIC provides benefits over existing
solutions:

- Applications that open both a reliable TLS stream and an unreliable
DTLS flow to the same peer can benefit by sharing a single handshake
and authentication context between a reliable QUIC stream and flow
of unreliable QUIC datagrams. This can reduce the latency required
for handshakes.

- QUIC uses a more nuanced loss recovery mechanism than the DTLS
handshake, which has a basic packet loss retransmission timer. This
can allow loss recovery to occur more quickly for QUIC data.

- QUIC datagrams are subject to QUIC congestion control. Providing a single
congestion control for both reliable and unreliable data can be more effective
and efficient.

These features can be useful for optimizing audio/video streaming applications,
gaming applications, and other real-time network applications.

Unreliable QUIC datagrams can also be used to implement an IP
packet tunnel over QUIC, such as for a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
Internet-layer tunneling protocols generally require a reliable and
authenticated handshake, followed by unreliable secure transmission
of IP packets. This can, for example, require a TLS connection for
the control data, and DTLS for tunneling IP packets. A single
QUIC connection could support both parts with the use of unreliable
datagrams.

# Transport Parameter

Support for receiving the DATAGRAM frame types is advertised by means
of a QUIC Transport Parameter (name=max_datagram_frame_size, value=0x0020).
The max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter is an integer value
(represented as a variable-length integer) that represents the maximum
size of a DATAGRAM frame (including the frame type, length, and
payload) the endpoint is willing to receive, in bytes.

The default for this parameter is 0, which indicates that the endpoint
does not support DATAGRAM frames. A value greater than 0 indicates
that the endpoint supports the DATAGRAM frame types and is willing to
receive such frames on this connection.

An endpoint MUST NOT send DATAGRAM frames until it has received the
max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter with a non-zero value. An
endpoint MUST NOT send DATAGRAM frames that are larger than the
max_datagram_frame_size value it has received from its peer.
An endpoint that receives a DATAGRAM frame when it has not indicated support
via the transport parameter MUST terminate the connection with an error of
type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION. Similarly, an endpoint that receives a DATAGRAM frame
that is larger than the value it sent in its max_datagram_frame_size
transport parameter MUST terminate the connection with an error of type
PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

For most uses of DATAGRAM frames, it is RECOMMENDED to send a value of 65535 in
the max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter to indicate that this endpoint
will accept any DATAGRAM frame that fits inside a QUIC packet.

The max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter is a unidirectional limit and
indication of support of DATAGRAM frames. Application protocols that use
DATAGRAM frames MAY choose to only negotiate and use them in a single direction.

When clients use 0-RTT, they MAY store the value of the server's
max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter. Doing so allows the client to send
DATAGRAM frames in 0-RTT packets. When servers decide to accept 0-RTT data,
they MUST send a max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter greater or equal
to the value they sent to the client in the connection where they sent them
the NewSessionTicket message. If a client stores the value of the
max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter with their 0-RTT state, they MUST
validate that the new value of the max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter
sent by the server in the handshake is greater or equal to the stored value;
if not, the client MUST terminate the connection with error PROTOCOL_VIOLATION.

Application protocols that use datagrams MUST define how they react to the
max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter being missing. If datagram support
is integral to the application, the application protocol can fail the handshake
if the max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter is not present.

## Disabling Eliciting ACKs

An endpoint can optionally send a separate QUIC Transport Parameter
(name=max_datagram_no_ack, value=0x0021). This parameter is a zero-length
value. When present, the parameter indicates to the receiver that DATAGRAM
frames do not elicit an acknowledgement.

# Datagram Frame Type

DATAGRAM frames are used to transmit application data in an unreliable manner.
The DATAGRAM frame type takes the form 0b0011000X (or the values 0x30
and 0x31). The least significant bit of the DATAGRAM frame type is the
LEN bit (0x01). It indicates that there is a Length field present. If this
bit is set to 0, the Length field is absent and the Datagram Data field extends
to the end of the packet. If this bit is set to 1, the Length field is present.

The DATAGRAM frame is structured as follows:

~~~
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                        [Length (i)]                         ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|                      Datagram Data (*)                      ...
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
~~~
{: #datagram-format title="DATAGRAM Frame Format"}

DATAGRAM frames contain the following fields:

Length:

: A variable-length integer specifying the length of the datagram in bytes. This field
is present only when the LEN bit is set. If the LEN bit is not set, the datagram data
extends to the end of the QUIC packet. Note that empty (i.e., zero-length)
datagrams are allowed.

Datagram Data:

: The bytes of the datagram to be delivered.

# Behavior and Usage

When an application sends an unreliable datagram over a QUIC connection,
QUIC will generate a new DATAGRAM frame and send it in the first available
packet. This frame SHOULD be sent as soon as possible, and MAY be
coalesced with other frames.

When a QUIC endpoint receives a valid DATAGRAM frame, it SHOULD deliver the
data to the application immediately, as long as it is able to process the frame
and can store the contents in memory.

DATAGRAM frames MUST be protected with either 0-RTT or 1-RTT keys.

Note that while the max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter places a limit
on the maximum size of DATAGRAM frames, that limit can be further reduced by
the max_packet_size transport parameter and the Maximum Transmission Unit
(MTU) of the path between endpoints. DATAGRAM frames cannot be fragmented,
therefore application protocols need to handle cases where the maximum datagram
size is limited by other factors.

## Multiplexing Datagrams

DATAGRAM frames belong to a QUIC connection as a whole, and are not strongly
associated with any stream ID at the QUIC layer. However, it is expected
that applications will want to differentiate between specific DATAGRAM frames
by using identifiers, such as for logical flows of datagrams or to distinguish
between different kinds of datagrams.

Identifiers used to multiplex different kinds of datagrams, or flows of
datagrams, are the responsibility of the application protocol running over QUIC
to define. The application defines the semantics of the Datagram Data field
and how it is parsed.

If the application needs to support the coexistence of multiple flows of
datagrams, one recommended pattern is to use a variable-length integer at the
beginning of the Datagram Data field.

QUIC implementations SHOULD present an API to applications to assign relative
priorities to DATAGRAM frames with respect to each other and to QUIC streams.

## Acknowledgement Handling

Although DATAGRAM frames are not retransmitted upon loss detection, they are
ack-eliciting ({{!RFC9002}}) unless the peer sent the max_datagram_no_ack transport
parameter. Receivers SHOULD support delaying ACK frames (within the limits
specified by max_ack_delay) in reponse to receiving packets that only contain
ack-eliciting DATAGRAM frames, since the timing of these acknowledgements is not
used for loss recovery.

As with any ack-eliciting frame, when a sender suspects that a packet containing
only DATAGRAM frames has been lost, it sends probe packets to elicit a faster
acknowledgement as described in {{Section 6.2.4 of RFC9002}}.

If a sender detects that a packet containing a specific DATAGRAM frame might
have been lost, the implementation MAY notify the application that it believes
the datagram was lost.

Similarly, if a packet containing a DATAGRAM frame is acknowledged, the
implementation MAY notify the sender application that the datagram was
successfully transmitted and received. Due to reordering, this can include a
DATAGRAM frame that was thought to be lost, but which at a later point was
received and acknowledged. It is important to note that acknowledgement of a
DATAGRAM frame only indicates that the transport-layer handling on the receiver
processed the frame, and does not guarantee that the application on the receiver
successfully processed the data. Thus, this signal cannot replace
application-layer signals that indicate successful processing.

## Flow Control

DATAGRAM frames do not provide any explicit flow control signaling,
and do not contribute to any per-flow or connection-wide data limit.

The risk associated with not providing flow control for DATAGRAM frames
is that a receiver might not be able to commit the necessary resources to process
the frames. For example, it might not be able to store the frame contents in memory.
However, since DATAGRAM frames are inherently unreliable, they MAY be
dropped by the receiver if the receiver cannot process them.

## Congestion Control

DATAGRAM frames employ the QUIC connection's congestion controller. As a
result, a connection might be unable to send a DATAGRAM frame generated by the
application until the congestion controller allows it
{{!RFC9002}}. The sender implementation MUST either delay
sending the frame until the controller allows it or drop the frame without
sending it (at which point it MAY notify the application). Implementations
that use packet pacing SHOULD support delaying the transmission of DATAGRAM
frames for at least the time it takes to send the paced packets allowed by the
congestion controller to avoid dropping frames excessively.

Implementations can optionally support allowing the application to specify
a sending expiration time, beyond which a congestion-controlled DATAGRAM
frame ought to be dropped without transmission.

Implementations that set max_datagram_no_ack should be wary of sending purely
DATAGRAM frames as this can lead an exhaustion of the congestion control windows.

# Security Considerations

The DATAGRAM frame shares the same security properties as the rest of
the data transmitted within a QUIC connection. All application data transmitted
with the DATAGRAM frame, like the STREAM frame, MUST be protected
either by 0-RTT or 1-RTT keys.

Application protocols that allow DATAGRAM frames to be sent in 0-RTT require a
profile that defines acceptable use of 0-RTT; see {{Section 5.6 of RFC9001}}.

The use of DATAGRAM frames might be detectable by an adversary on path that is
capable of dropping packets. Since DATAGRAM frames do not use transport-level
retransmission, connections that use DATAGRAM frames might be distinguished from
other frames using the different response to loss.

# IANA Considerations

This document registers a new value in the QUIC Transport Parameter Registry:

Value:

: 0x0020 (if this document is approved)

Parameter Name:

: max_datagram_frame_size

Specification:

: A non-zero value indicates that the endpoint supports receiving unreliable
DATAGRAM frames. An endpoint that advertises this transport parameter can receive
DATAGRAM frames from the other endpoint, up to and including the length in
bytes provided in the transport parameter. The default value is 0.

This document also registers a new value in the QUIC Frame Type registry:

Value:

: 0x30 and 0x31 (if this document is approved)

Frame Name:

: DATAGRAM

Specification:

: Unreliable application data
